<font face="icon-large"><p> Necessary steps must be taken to clean the environment and prevent any further damage to it. Following are some important points to the preservation of a clean environment: </font></p>

<ul type"circle"><font face="Garamond" color="maroon" size="6">
<li>Make Environment Friendly Policies</li></font>
<p> Environment-friendly policies are in layman’s terms the guidelines for industrial or infrastructural development that claim reduced or minimal effect on the environment. A government while making political decisions for the growth of industries and urbanization should consider its impact on the environment and take necessary steps to minimize it.</p>


<font face="Garamond" color="maroon" size="6"><li>Plant a Tree</li></font>
<p>Society and an individual should take an active part in adding to a clean and healthy environment by pledging to plant a tree in the surroundings every weekend or on off days.</p>


<font face="Garamond" color="maroon" size="6"><li>Reduce your Electricity Usage</li></font>
<p>Using too much electricity increases its demand which results in increased production of electricity consequently resulting in more burning of fuel, usage of water, and emission of tons of CO2 gas in the environment, leading to global warming. Usage of renewable energy sources like wind and water etc instead of conventional sources results in the reduction of environmental pollution.</p>


<font face="Garamond"  color="maroon" size="6"><li>Go Paperless</li></font>
<p>Reduce the use of paper in your workplace. A decreased demand for paper will reduce the cutting of trees. Spread awareness among your colleagues and fellow students or society about the importance of trees and their contribution towards clean air and how we can help in their preservation by reducing the usage of paper in our offices, schools, hospitals, and other establishments.</p>


<font face="Garamond" font size="6" color="maroon"><li>Buy Recycled Products</li></font>
<p>By purchasing products with recycled content you prevent those materials from ending up in a landfill and do your part to maintain consumer demand for recyclables and ensure the continuation of a balanced ecosystem.</p>


<font face="Garamond" font size="6" color="maroon"><li>Go Green on Transport</li></font>
<p>Transportation alone accounts for a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions. So, next time if you plan a trip to your favorite place with family and friends avoid using more vehicles than needed or use public transport if it is safe to do so. People around the world are developing an affinity towards vehicles that have zero emissions such as vehicles running on electricity or solar energy.</p>


<font face="Garamond"  size="6" color="maroon"><li>Use of Organic Pesticides</li></font>
<p>Overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has adverse effects on the soil organisms similar to human overuse of anti-biotics. While beneficial for crops they can hurt the health of species directly or indirectly exposed to such environment. Use of Organic pesticides which are made up of minerals or other plant materials that keep pests at bay and break down quickly in the soil help prevent pollution due to hazardous chemicals. Some examples are Cayenne pepper spray, neem, sabadilla, pyrethrin, soap spray, etc.</p>


<font face="Garamond"  size="6" color="maroon"><li>Building Environment Friendly Cities</li></font>
<p> The Government should frame laws that plan and provide cities that are environment friendly and consider a clean environment as the basic need of its people. Government should encourage sustainable use of urban resources and encourage the use of green energy.
Buildings and houses should be designed in a way to uses natural resources to the fullest. Permitting sunlight to the maximum in a building will result in the reduction of electricity usage. Steps should be taken for the accumulation and conservation of rainwater to meet everyday water requirements.</p>
