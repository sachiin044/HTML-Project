<b><font size="5"><p> 
Damage to the environment by Human activities such as industrialization, deforestation, urbanization etc greatly adds to the environmental pollution.A lot is being said and heard these days about the need for a clean environment and the steps that must be taken for the reduction of environmental pollution and to give way to a clean and healthy eco-system. Some of the prime factors leading to a damaged environment are narrated below :-
<ul><font size="6" face="Courier New" color="red">

<li> Explosion of Harmful Gases </li></font>
<font size="5"><p> Gases such as CO<sub>2</sub> (Carbon di-oxide), CO (Carbon mono oxide), NH<sub>3</sub> (Ammonia) do a considerable amount of damage to the environment.Human activities like burning of fossil fuel, cement production etc results in the emission of CO<sub>2</sub> gas. On the other hand the major source of NH<sub>3</sub> emission is the agriculture sector, where ammonia based fertilizers are used. NH<sub>3</sub>  plays a significant role in the production of Atmospheric Particulate Matter (APM), depleting the quality index of breathable air.</font></p>

<li> Deforestion </li></font>
<font size="5"><p>Manï¿½s insatiable desires to expand his wealth and boundaries have lead to unreasonable deforestation. One of the major effects of deforestation is the increase in the level of the environmental CO<sub>2</sub>. Cutting down forest add more to the global warming than the factors like cars and trucks combined. Deforestation results in global climate changes and a depletion in bio diversity.</p></font>

<font size="6" face="Courier New" color="red">
<li> Industry </li></font>
<font size="5"><p>Increase in industrial activity particularly mining industry adds to the environmental pollution. Mining industry results in the emission if RPM (Respirable Particulate matter). Into the atmosphere RPM are the particulate matter present in the environment that can travel to our lungs as we breathe, affecting our respiratory system, also results in aggravation of diseases like asthma etc and decreasing the efficiency of lungs.</font></p>

<font size="6" face="Courier New" color="red">
<li> Transportation </li></font>
<font size="5"><p>Transportation results in burning of petroleum fuel worldwide, resulting in the emission of harmful gases such as Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and Nitrous Oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O). Researches have shown that on road vehicles contribute to one third of the air pollution that produces smog and results in the emission of greenhouse gases.</font></p>

<font size="6" face="Courier New" color="red">
<li>Urbanization</li></font>
<font size="5"><p>Urbanization is inevitable as man explores new horizons to reside in cities leaving the primitive lifestyle the villages have to offer.  The environment in which urban people live depends hugely on their habits and lifestyle. Urbanization leads to deforestation and reduction in natural resources most prominently water.  An unchecked urbanization will have a disastrous effect on the environment resulting in the demise of many living species.</font></p>

<font size="6" face="Courier New" color="red">
<li>Secondary Pollutants</li></font>
<font size="5"><p>Ozone layer is responsible for the protection of earth species from strong ultra violet radiations from Sun, which could result in deadly disorders like skin cancer, cataract and a reduction in the immune system.Various human activities such as use of unchecked Air Conditioners, pesticides etc results in the emission of ODS (Ozone Depleting Substances) also known as secondary pollutants, which results in the holes into the ozone layer exposing living beings to harmful UV rays from the sun.</font></p>

<font size="6" face="Courier New" color="red">
<li>Population Explosion</li></font>
<font size="5"><p>The expanse in population results in the urbanization and consequently deforestation. It also results in the depletion of the natural resources such as water and farm produces, having an adverse effect on the environment. Due to the vast population same resources should cater to the more number of people resulting to a strain on natural resources.</font></p>

<font size="6" face="Courier New" color="red">
<li>Unplanned Development</li></font>
<font size="5"><p>Our insatiable desire to increase our wealth and make our life more comfortable in our day to day activity has lead to unnecessary and unplanned development of cities around us. Unplanned development leads to poor sanitary habits, air pollution because necessary steps for its prevention are not taken. Resulting in poor health of the society.</font></p>

<font size="6" face="Courier New" color="red">
<li>Littering</li></font>
<font size="5"><p>People most often litter waste in their surroundings which with the passage of time accumulates and transforms into garbage, resulting in environmental pollution.
Littering is often the main cause for that foul smell you encounter while passing through a particular location. Accumulation of garbage results in deadly diseases such as malaria and cholera to name few. The harmful materials present in a garbage can found its way into water and soil polluting them and causing life threatening diseases.</font></p></ul>
